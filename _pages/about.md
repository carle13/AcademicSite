I am a Guatemala PhD student at Linköping University. My research focuses on studying mechanical properties of ceramics at high temperature.

I am a Guatemalan graduate student at Aix-Marseille Université. I have always been a curious and inventive person. My desire to understand things pushed me to study physics. And my desire to create pushed me to learn programming and minor in computer science.
